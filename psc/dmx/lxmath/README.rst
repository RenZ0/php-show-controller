LxMath
===============================================================================

LxMath is a simple single page application for theatrical electricians.
It can convert 16bit values to two 8 bit values, absolute addresses to
universe/address notation, and back for both.  As a bonus it can
show dip switch positions, with 1 for on and 0 for off.
