PSC - Php-Show-Controller
-------------------------

PSC provides an interface to create DMX shows, and play those thanks to OLA.

Project Page: http://imaginux.com/lighting/
Licence: GNU General Public Licence 2 (See LICENCE)


Requirements
------------

This software requires:

   - webserver like apache with php/mysql support
   - python 2.7 (earlier versions may also work)
   - ola >= 0.8.14 (must be built with --enable-python-libs)


Installation
------------

First, you need to set up your webserver, for example on debian/ubuntu :
sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5-mysql phpmyadmin python-mysqldb

Create a new database, for example : psc
You can use phpmyadmin to do this, or mysql client :

mysql -uroot -p
create database psc;
quit;

Import the sql file psc_base.sql.gz into the new database.
Again you can use phpmyadmin, or the command line :

gzip -d psc_base.sql.gz
mysql -uroot -p psc < psc_base.sql

According to your webserver access, fill these files :
engine/config.py
psc/config.php

Move the psc folder into the webserver root :
sudo cp -r psc/ /var/www/

PSC is ready !


About php
---------

Usually, you can keep php default settings :
register_globals = Off
short_open_tag = On

Those commands could be usefull (debian/ubuntu) :
sudo gedit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart


Getting Started
---------------

You need to have OLA working :
http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA

You can get deb packages on my website :
http://imaginux.com/lighting/

Start OLA, for example :
olad -f (background)
or
olad -l3 (with log)

Configure OLA universes from :
http://127.0.0.1:9090

From the engine folder, simply run 'python server.py'.
Python will tell you if modules missing, like python-mysqldb.

Go to your webserver url (with your web browser), for example :
http://127.0.0.1/psc


How to use PSC ?
----------------

0) Set language in Preferences : en = english, fr = french.
RGB and CMY checkboxes are for display in scenario creation.
Univ. is the number of universes you want to use (set up in OLA).
Engine Rate is set into database.

1) Add your fixtures infos in Profiles page :
Add each channel, default value and describe its function.
You can group some channels if you want, adding a dot between values.

RGB and CMY are special and names need to start with 'rgb' and 'cmy'.
You can make virtual fixtures using the 'Multi' feature.
Take care to not modify your profiles after scenario creation.

2) Set universes and addresses in Fixtures page.

3) Scenarios : add one and click on its name :
You will be able to define each step.

On the right of channel name, the o letter will display dmx info
(defined in your profile).

Color changes, included random and gradient are made on 'rgb'
channels by default.
Save the colors or values you want into the bank (Colors page).

Use the checkboxes to make partial changes.
Try the filter to show channels you want, and make fast changes
(with filter, 'ALL' button applies value on every channel seen).

You can disable, duplicate a step with X or # symbol.

D,w and R,w letters are used to generate many steps from original step :
D : first rgb color moves over rgb channels, going to last one.
R : first rgb color recover rgb channels, until all changed.
w is the same but rewind, it uses the last color instead of first one.
(these features only work with channels named like rgb1 to rgbX)

Use buttons (list, start...) to play the scenario
and see the result while you create.
Go to Steps page to change hold and fade times.

4) Play the scenarios you've created from Control page.
Control can be done with python too :

python test.py start.1 (where 1 is scenario's id)
python test.py stop.1
python test.py status.1
python test.py list
python test.py stopall
python test.py bo


Troubleshooting
---------------

Sometimes things don't always work as expected.
Often it's just a setting, please double check everything.

Keep in mind :
With php interface you change sql data.
Python engine reads sql data, and send it to OLA.
OLA use your hardware to send DMX signal.
